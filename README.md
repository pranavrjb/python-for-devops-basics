# Python for DevOps - Beginner Fundamentals

Welcome to my python basics repository!
This is part of my **Public Learning Journey**, as I dive into the world of DevOps. I'm starting by building strong foundation with Python.

# Why This Repo?

Before diving into tools like Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines and Docker, I wanted to:

- Strengthen my programming fundamentals.
- Learn how scripting fits into automation.
- Document my progress and help others just starting out.

# What's Inside?

# Topic
-- Variables & Data Types
-- Strings, List and Tuples
-- Set & Dictionaries
-- Loops
-- Conditional Expression
-- Function & Recursion
-- File Handling
-- Object-Oriented Programing (Inheritance)
-- Exception Handling

-- Some Small Projects

# What's Next?
This is just the first step of my journey. I'll be learning:
- Linux commands & Shell Scriptings
- Git & GitHub version control
- CI/CD fundamentals
- Cloud platforms
- Docker & Containers

I'll keep sharing all my codes and blog along the way.
