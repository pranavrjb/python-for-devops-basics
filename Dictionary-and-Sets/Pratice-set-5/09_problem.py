# Can you change the value inside a list which is contained in set s?

s={8,7,11,"Ram",[5,6]}

# Here, we cannot change the value inside a list contained in a set. Moreover, we cannot add list in the set, as set are immutable and hashable but list are mutable and not hashable, so they cannot be added to a set.
